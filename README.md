# CodeAlpha_task_ImageGallery
 This image gallery was developed during my internship at Code Alpha to showcase problem-solving and coding skills. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the gallery features filters for easy navigation. This project enhanced my web development skills and meets the requirements assigned by my company.
